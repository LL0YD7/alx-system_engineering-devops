1.DNS request: When you type in a URL like https://www.google.com, your browser first needs to translate this human-readable address into an IP address that computers can understand. This is done through a Domain Name System (DNS) request, where your browser looks up the IP address associated with the domain name.
2.TCP/IP: Once the IP address is obtained, your browser establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite. This allows for reliable communication over the internet.
3.Firewall: The request passes through any firewalls that may be in place to protect the network. Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
4.HTTPS/SSL: If the website is using HTTPS, a secure connection is established using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This encrypts the data being transmitted between your browser and the server, ensuring privacy and security.
5.Load-balancer: In the case of a high-traffic website like Google, the request may pass through a load balancer. This distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and prevent overload.
6.Web server: The request finally reaches the web server hosting the website. The web server processes the request, retrieves the requested web page, and sends it back to the browser.
7.Application server: In some cases, the web server may need to communicate with an application server to process dynamic content. The application server executes the necessary code and generates the content to be sent back to the web server.
8.Database: If the requested content is stored in a database, the application server may need to query the database to retrieve the relevant information. The database server processes the query and returns the data to the application server.
